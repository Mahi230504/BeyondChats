--- Summary Quote ---
But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I&#x27;m also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I&#x27;ve only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.

  > "The NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it&#x27;s dead."

--- Frustrations ---
- Game limitations and design inefficiencies

  > "The problem I&#x27;m encountering is that it just stops responding after 5 back-and-fourth. Restarting it doesn&#x27;t help either. I agree the quality has degraded since they came out with the new price tier"
